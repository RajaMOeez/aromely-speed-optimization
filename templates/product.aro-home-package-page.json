The alcohol will help to cleanse and sanitize the interior components.</li><li><strong>Empty the Alcohol</strong>: After 30 minutes, turn off the diffuser and safely dispose of the isopropyl alcohol.</li><li><strong>Drying</strong>: Allow the bottle and diffuser components to air dry completely. It's crucial to ensure no alcohol residue remains before the next use.</li><li><strong>Refill and Use</strong>: Once everything is dry, you can refill the diffuser with your preferred oil and use it as usual.</li></ol><p>This cleaning method is a good practice to maintain your diffuser, especially if you frequently change oils or notice a decrease in performance. </p>"
